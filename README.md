Performance focused interpolation

Based on the original work of Dmitry Komanov (https://medium.com/@dkomanov/scala-string-interpolation-performance-21dc85e83afd).

Note: the current version of the interpolation Macro is a complete rip-off of [fast-string-interpolator](https://github.com/Sizmek/fast-string-interpolator) as their performance is superior, but they don't currently support Scala.js or Scala Native.

## What is it?

As shown in the article by Dmitry Komanov, Scala's `s""` and `f""` interpolation are incredibly slow. This is an effort
make String interpolation as fast as it should be with the additional features of type-safe formatting with code-completion.

## Main Features

### String interpolation

Original:
```scala
s"Interpolation of $string"
```

Better:
```scala
p"Interpolation of $string"
```

### Type-safe alternatives to String format

Original:
```scala
f"Time: $timeInMillis%tT, Date: $timeInMillis%tD"
```

Better:
```scala
p"Time: ${timeInMillis.t.T}, Date: ${timeInMillis.t.D}"
```

## Getting Started

Support for Scala (2.11, 2.12, 2.13, 3.0.0-M3), Scala.js (2.11, 2.12, 2.13, 3.0.0-M3)
and ScalaNative (2.11, 2.12, 2.13)

SBT Dependencies:

```
libraryDependencies += "com.outr" %%% "perfolation" % "1.0.4"
```

Usage:

Simply import `perfolation._` and start using:

```scala
import perfolation._

val greeting = "Hello, World!"
val time = System.currentTimeMillis()

println(p"$greeting @ ${time.t.T}")
```
